## Trading Strategies

The bot implements multiple sophisticated trading strategies, each designed to exploit different market inefficiencies and opportunities in event-based markets.

### News Sentiment Analysis Strategy

This strategy leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze news articles, social media posts, and other textual data sources to gauge market sentiment and predict event outcomes.

#### Methodology
The strategy operates through several key phases:

**Data Collection**: The system continuously monitors multiple news sources, including major news outlets, financial news services, and relevant social media feeds. Data is collected in real-time using RSS feeds, APIs, and web scraping techniques where appropriate.

**Text Preprocessing**: Raw text data undergoes extensive preprocessing including tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and normalization. The system also handles multiple languages and can process various text formats.

**Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced NLP models, including pre-trained transformer models and custom-trained classifiers, analyze the sentiment of collected text. The system generates sentiment scores ranging from -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive).

**Event Correlation**: Sentiment scores are correlated with specific events listed on Kalshi. The system maintains a mapping between keywords, entities, and events to ensure accurate attribution of sentiment to relevant markets.

**Signal Generation**: When sentiment scores exceed predefined thresholds and show statistical significance, the system generates trading signals. The strength of the signal is proportional to the sentiment score and the confidence level of the analysis.

#### Implementation Details
```python
def analyze_news_sentiment(self, news_data, event_keywords):
    """
    Analyze sentiment of news data related to specific events
    """
    sentiment_scores = []
    for article in news_data:
        # Preprocess text
        cleaned_text = self.preprocess_text(article['content'])
        
        # Check relevance to event
        relevance_score = self.calculate_relevance(cleaned_text, event_keywords)
        
        if relevance_score > self.relevance_threshold:
            # Analyze sentiment
            sentiment = self.sentiment_model.predict(cleaned_text)
            weighted_sentiment = sentiment * relevance_score
            sentiment_scores.append(weighted_sentiment)
    
    # Aggregate sentiment scores
    if sentiment_scores:
        avg_sentiment = np.mean(sentiment_scores)
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(sentiment_scores)
        return avg_sentiment, confidence
    
    return 0, 0
```

### Statistical Arbitrage Strategy

Statistical arbitrage exploits pricing discrepancies between related events or contracts. This strategy is particularly effective in prediction markets where multiple contracts may be related to the same underlying phenomenon.

#### Core Concepts
The strategy identifies situations where the combined probabilities of related events don't sum to 100%, or where correlated events show pricing inconsistencies that can be exploited through simultaneous long and short positions.

**Correlation Analysis**: The system continuously analyzes historical price movements between different event contracts to identify strong correlations. Events that typically move together (positive correlation) or in opposite directions (negative correlation) are flagged for arbitrage opportunities.

**Price Relationship Modeling**: Using statistical techniques such as cointegration analysis and regression modeling, the system establishes expected price relationships between correlated events. When actual prices deviate significantly from these expected relationships, arbitrage opportunities are identified.

**Risk-Neutral Arbitrage**: The strategy attempts to construct risk-neutral portfolios by taking offsetting positions in related contracts. This approach aims to profit from price convergence while minimizing exposure to the actual event outcomes.

#### Example Implementation
Consider two related political events: "Candidate A wins primary" and "Candidate A wins general election." The probability of winning the general election cannot exceed the probability of winning the primary. If market prices suggest otherwise, an arbitrage opportunity exists.

```python
def identify_arbitrage_opportunity(self, primary_contract, general_contract):
    """
    Identify arbitrage opportunities between related political contracts
    """
    primary_prob = primary_contract.yes_price / (primary_contract.yes_price + primary_contract.no_price)
    general_prob = general_contract.yes_price / (general_contract.yes_price + general_contract.no_price)
    
    # General election probability should not exceed primary probability
    if general_prob > primary_prob + self.arbitrage_threshold:
        # Arbitrage opportunity: sell general election, buy primary
        return {
            'action': 'arbitrage',
            'long_contract': primary_contract,
            'short_contract': general_contract,
            'expected_profit': (general_prob - primary_prob) * self.position_size,
            'confidence': self.calculate_arbitrage_confidence(primary_contract, general_contract)
        }
    
    return None
```

### Volatility-Based Strategy

This strategy capitalizes on volatility patterns in event contract prices, identifying opportunities when volatility is unusually high or low relative to historical norms.

#### Volatility Measurement
The system calculates multiple volatility metrics:
- **Historical Volatility**: Standard deviation of price changes over various time periods
- **Implied Volatility**: Derived from option-like characteristics of event contracts
- **Realized Volatility**: Actual price movements compared to expected movements

#### Trading Logic
High volatility periods often present opportunities to sell overpriced contracts, while low volatility periods may offer chances to buy underpriced contracts before significant price movements.

**Mean Reversion**: When volatility is extremely high, the strategy may take positions expecting prices to revert to historical means.

**Momentum Trading**: During periods of sustained directional movement with increasing volatility, the strategy may take positions in the direction of the trend.

**Volatility Breakouts**: The system identifies periods of low volatility followed by sudden increases, often indicating significant new information entering the market.

## Risk Management

Comprehensive risk management is fundamental to the bot's design, incorporating multiple layers of protection to preserve capital and ensure sustainable trading operations.

### Position Sizing

The bot employs sophisticated position sizing algorithms that consider multiple factors:

**Kelly Criterion Implementation**: The system uses a modified Kelly Criterion to determine optimal position sizes based on the estimated probability of success and potential payoffs. This mathematical approach maximizes long-term growth while controlling risk.

```python
def calculate_kelly_position_size(self, win_probability, win_amount, loss_amount):
    """
    Calculate optimal position size using Kelly Criterion
    """
    if win_probability <= 0 or win_probability >= 1:
        return 0
    
    # Kelly fraction = (bp - q) / b
    # where b = odds received on the wager
    # p = probability of winning
    # q = probability of losing (1 - p)
    
    b = win_amount / abs(loss_amount)
    kelly_fraction = (win_probability * b - (1 - win_probability)) / b
    
    # Apply conservative scaling factor
    conservative_fraction = kelly_fraction * self.kelly_scaling_factor
    
    # Ensure position size doesn't exceed maximum limits
    max_position = self.bankroll * self.max_position_percentage
    optimal_position = min(conservative_fraction * self.bankroll, max_position)
    
    return max(0, optimal_position)
```

**Volatility Adjustment**: Position sizes are adjusted based on market volatility. During high volatility periods, position sizes are reduced to account for increased uncertainty.

**Correlation Adjustment**: When multiple positions are correlated, the system reduces individual position sizes to maintain overall portfolio risk within acceptable limits.

### Stop-Loss Mechanisms

The bot implements multiple types of stop-loss mechanisms:

**Fixed Percentage Stop-Loss**: Positions are automatically closed when losses exceed a predetermined percentage of the entry price.

**Trailing Stop-Loss**: For profitable positions, the stop-loss level is adjusted upward as the position becomes more profitable, locking in gains while allowing for continued upside.

**Time-Based Stop-Loss**: Positions may be closed based on time decay, particularly important for event contracts with specific expiration dates.

**Volatility-Adjusted Stop-Loss**: Stop-loss levels are adjusted based on current market volatility, providing wider stops during volatile periods and tighter stops during calm markets.

### Portfolio-Level Risk Controls

**Maximum Daily Loss**: The system will halt trading if daily losses exceed a predetermined threshold, preventing catastrophic losses during adverse market conditions.

**Concentration Limits**: No single event or category of events can represent more than a specified percentage of the total portfolio.

**Correlation Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors correlations between positions and adjusts exposure when correlations become too high.

**Drawdown Protection**: If the portfolio experiences a significant drawdown, the system may reduce position sizes or temporarily halt trading to preserve capital.

### Dynamic Risk Adjustment

Risk parameters are not static but adjust based on:
- **Market Conditions**: Risk tolerance increases during stable markets and decreases during volatile periods
- **Performance History**: Recent performance affects risk appetite, with successful periods allowing for slightly increased risk
- **Event Characteristics**: Different types of events (political, economic, weather) may warrant different risk approaches
- **Time to Expiration**: Risk parameters adjust based on how much time remains until event resolution

### Adding New Strategies

To add a new trading strategy:

1. Create a new file in `src/strategies/`
2. Implement the strategy class with required methods
3. Register the strategy in `src/trader.py`
4. Add configuration parameters to `src/config.py`
5. Write tests in `tests/`

Example strategy template:
```python
class NewStrategy:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
    
    def analyze(self, market_data):
        """Analyze market data and return trading signals"""
        pass
    
    def generate_signals(self, analysis_result):
        """Generate specific trading signals"""
        pass
```

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites:

```bash

### Monitoring and Logging

#### Log Management
```bash
# Create log directories
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/kalshi-bot
sudo chown kalshi-bot:kalshi-bot /var/log/kalshi-bot

# Configure log rotation
sudo tee /etc/logrotate.d/kalshi-bot << EOF
/var/log/kalshi-bot/*.log {
    daily
    missingok
    rotate 30
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 644 kalshi-bot kalshi-bot
    postrotate
        supervisorctl restart kalshi-trading-bot kalshi-telegram-bot kalshi-bot-interface
    endscript
}
EOF
```

#### Health Monitoring
Set up monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana:

```python
# Add to src/monitoring.py
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge, start_http_server

# Metrics
trades_total = Counter('kalshi_trades_total', 'Total number of trades')
trade_duration = Histogram('kalshi_trade_duration_seconds', 'Trade execution time')
account_balance = Gauge('kalshi_account_balance', 'Current account balance')
open_positions = Gauge('kalshi_open_positions', 'Number of open positions')

# Start metrics server
start_http_server(8000)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. API Connection Errors
**Symptoms**: Bot fails to connect to Kalshi API
**Solutions**:
- Verify API key is correct and active
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure API endpoints are accessible
- Review rate limiting settings

```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets
```

#### 2. Telegram Bot Not Responding
**Symptoms**: Telegram bot doesn't respond to commands
**Solutions**:
- Verify bot token is correct
- Check if bot is running
- Ensure webhook is not set (for polling mode)
- Review Telegram API limits

```bash
# Check bot status
curl https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getMe
```

#### 3. High Memory Usage
**Symptoms**: System runs out of memory
**Solutions**:
- Implement data cleanup routines
- Optimize data structures
- Add memory monitoring
- Consider increasing system memory

```python
# Add memory monitoring
import psutil
import gc

def monitor_memory():
    process = psutil.Process()
    memory_info = process.memory_info()
    print(f"Memory usage: {memory_info.rss / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
    
    if memory_info.rss > 1024 * 1024 * 1024:  # 1GB
        gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection
```

#### 4. Trading Strategy Errors
**Symptoms**: Strategies produce unexpected results
**Solutions**:
- Review strategy parameters
- Check data quality
- Validate market conditions
- Run backtests to verify logic

### Debugging Tools

#### 1. Logging Configuration
```python
import logging

# Configure detailed logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('debug.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

#### 2. Performance Profiling
```python
import cProfile
import pstats

# Profile trading function
profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()

# Run trading logic
trader.run_trading_strategy()

profiler.disable()
stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
stats.print_stats(20)
```

#### 3. Market Data Validation
```python
def validate_market_data(data):
    """Validate market data integrity"""
    required_fields = ['id', 'title', 'yes_price', 'no_price']
    
    for market in data.get('markets', []):
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in market:
                raise ValueError(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        
        # Validate price ranges
        if not (0 <= market['yes_price'] <= 1):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid yes_price: {market['yes_price']}")
        
        if not (0 <= market['no_price'] <= 1):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid no_price: {market['no_price']}")
```

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Database Optimization
```python
# Use connection pooling
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool

engine = create_engine(
    'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/kalshi',
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=20
)
```

#### 2. Caching Implementation
```python
from functools import lru_cache
import redis

# Redis cache
redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_market_data(market_id):
    """Cache market data to reduce API calls"""
    cached_data = redis_client.get(f"market:{market_id}")
    if cached_data:
        return json.loads(cached_data)
    
    # Fetch from API
    data = api.get_market(market_id)
    redis_client.setex(f"market:{market_id}", 60, json.dumps(data))
    return data
```

#### 3. Asynchronous Processing
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_multiple_markets(market_ids):
    """Fetch multiple markets concurrently"""
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_market(session, market_id) for market_id in market_ids]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return results

async def fetch_market(session, market_id):
    """Fetch single market data"""
    url = f"https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets/{market_id}"
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.json()
```
